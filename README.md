# Red-Wine-prediction
The data set we selected is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. This data was collected from red and white wine samples where physicochemical qualities were from objective tests such as a pH tests and the quality score was based on experts grading the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
